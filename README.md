# FRC_TEAM_7538_2025_REEFSCAPE

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2025 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to. XD

## What does it do?
JAVA: Second year implementing swerve, using kraken swerve with L3, an elevator with two Falcon 500s, a climber with two Falcon 500s, and neo 550s on the algae and coral intake/delivery. 

## Plans for future iterations of the code
We hope to pass on the knowlege gained from past members to avoid mistakes and create a consistient viable robot. Implementing Autonomous routines through Pathplanner soon

## Versions:
1.0.0 Second robot for team 7538 with swerve drive!
